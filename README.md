This will be the landing page for the app and inform the users what it is that they will get getting from the app and how the app can be used to help them meet their goals. 

"/login"
This is where the user will either be able to login with Oauth or email and password

this page will be where we gather the needed information from the user and return the collected data too the database to be used at a later time

"/authorized"
This will be the page that the user sees when they have successfuly complete the sign up or have completed the login verification. 
This page will show the saved lifts for the used and allow them to add lifts that they want in the future and set and adjust those numbers 
if the completed butten on each lift is pressed the lift will have 5 pounds added too it for the next session 
if the fail button is pressed then the user will have the sets and reps adjusted to make up for the lift being missed and the numbers will be kept the same for the next session
