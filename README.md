/*********************Takeaways*******************/

        2 Examples of things we enjoyed or learned from this project

1. Working with each other on this project was fun other than the deployment and DB
   issues. We worked really well together and
   were on the same page about pretty much everything. Literally couldn't have asked for a better partner.

2. I really enjoyed learning different styling techniques and messing with the 
   buttons.

        2 Examples of things we did not enjoy or wanted to learn from this project

1. Fly.io I'm sure has great people working for it. However, the amount of pain and
   suffering it has caused Dan and I is devastating. No matter what we did we could not get the DB to work or deploy. We even tried starting from scratch and trying to get a basic hellofly app to deploy and we had no luck. On top of that, the amount of documentation on DB and Deploying troubleshooting is little to none. WE NEED MORE DOCUMENTATION!!

2. I really wanted to learn how to use react so it could make transitioning this 
   from a web app to a mobile app. However, we spent most of our time on deploying
   and trying to get the DB to work that we could not.


WE ARE NOT LETTING THIS STOP US. 5 More will be on the app store in the future, so just keep an eye on us. And just ask yourself "What's 5 More?"
If you haven't realized by now, that's our slogan. Its got a nice ring to it.


/****************************current issues that are being worked on*************************************/
1.Oauth api key needs to be aproved and set 
2.hashing and salting for passwords on the db 
3.deployment is still an issue but the video from lecture 11 needs to be reviewed and a basic app can be deolpyed in the same manner 
4.we are not able to deploy anything to fly.io at all now even when we were able to deploy the base app before. nothing we can do about that so we are skipping deployment. This means that we cannot get a database working tho with fly and I have been trying to get a local db running but for some reason I can not connect to the local db to be able to test if anything we are working on is working.
